                <li>Pasta noodles (such as spaghetti, penne, or fettuccine)</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Salt (for seasoning the water)</li>
                <li>Optional: Olive oil (to prevent sticking)</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with water, leaving enough room for the pasta to expand while cooking.</li>
            <li>Place the pot on the stove and bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, add salt to season the water. Use about 1-2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water.</li>
            <li>Optional: Add a splash of olive oil to the boiling water to help prevent the pasta from sticking together.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta noodles to the boiling water, stirring gently to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta according to package instructions or until al dente, which means the pasta is cooked through but still firm to the bite.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is done, carefully drain it in a colander placed in the sink.</li>
            <li>Transfer the drained pasta back to the pot or a serving dish.</li>
            <li>Top the pasta with your desired sauce, such as marinara, Alfredo, or pesto, and toss gently to coat.</li>
            <li>Optional: Add any additional toppings or ingredients, such as grated cheese, herbs, or vegetables.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta hot and enjoy!</li>
